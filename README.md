# XKN
eXtreme KNOMI

A complete rewrite of the Firmware for KNOMI. No GIF-Animations, just raw and beautiful data.
This rewrite also makes OTA (over-the-air) updates possible.

# Installation

Install VSCode and PlatformUI, open this project, copy myconfig_example.h, rename it to myconfig.h, change the settings according to your setup and upload the result to your KNOMI.
You propably will have to change the name of the chamber sensor in line 25 of printer.cpp.

I will do some refactorings in the future to make this setup easier.
